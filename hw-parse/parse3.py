class Agenda:
    """An agenda of items that need to be processed.  Newly built items 
    may be enqueued for processing by `push()`, and should eventually be

    This implementation of an agenda also remembers which items have
    been pushed before, even if they have subsequently been popped.
    This is because already popped items must still be found by
    duplicate detection and as customers for attach.  

    (In general, AI algorithms often maintain a "closed list" (or
    "chart") of items that have already been popped, in addition to
    the "open list" (or "agenda") of items that are still waiting to pop.)

    In Earley's algorithm, each end position has its own agenda -- a column
    in the parse chart.  (This contrasts with agenda-based parsing, which uses
    a single agenda for all items.)

    Standardly, each column's agenda is implemented as a FIFO queue
    with duplicate detection, and that is what is implemented here.
    However, other implementations are possible -- and could be useful
    when dealing with weights, backpointers, and optimizations.

    >>> a = Agenda()
    >>> a.push(3)
    >>> a.push(5)
    >>> a.push(3)   # duplicate ignored
    >>> a
    Agenda([]; [3, 5])

    Agenda([3]; [5])
    >>> a.push(3)   # duplicate ignored
    >>> a.push(7)
    >>> a
